# React Login Feature

This repository is a compilation of a login feature in React as a reference to a Login Feature Blog Series. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the block post series React Login Feature.  It walks through all considerations from the initial start of a react project building the routing, UI implementations, state, localstorage vs cookie persistence, API connections, testing and deployment into another app to test its drop in feature effectiveness. 

Every developer requires component features that provide services for the different general website and app functionalities. This feature is a login app component. Other features could include carts, payment, storefront frameworks etc. 


{: note}
“For the final tested implementation, see main branch.
post01–post07 branches accompany the blog posts.”


If you are insterested in just grabbing an app framework pre-build head to the [base-login-app] (https://base-login-app) repo to start a fresh tailwind driven site with the login dropped in for you. Follow its npm installations and readme information.
